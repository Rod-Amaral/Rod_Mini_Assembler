Rod's Mini Assembler Tool, is a simple tool to create binary files from source code files written in hexadecimal.

It can read a text file written in hexadecimal characters, ignoring spaces, tabs and newlines. It then creates a binary file representing that hexadecimal file.

The Mini Assembler can also read a binary file and output it in binary / hexadecimal characters onto stdout.
